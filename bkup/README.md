1. When the page loads the current month and year should be displayed with the current day highlighted. 
1. Events should appear on the calendar on the appropriate day list the time and title of the event.
1. Clicking the event should display additional details about the event including but not limited to: the event title, time and description.
1. The user should be able to add new event.
1. The user should be able to edit or delete existing events.
1. At least one Vue Component should be used. 
1. At least on Vue Transition should be used.
1. All event data should be stored to localStorage. 
1. The web application should have an appealing and intuitive user experience.

## Working with Dates

As a calendar web application, naturally the project will require working with dates and times. As such, you will need to use of the [JavaScript Date](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date) object or a JavaScript Library like [moment.js](https://momentjs.com). This is not a topic that will be directly covered in this class, but below you will find a list of tutorials and resources that will help.
